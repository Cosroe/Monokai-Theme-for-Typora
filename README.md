This is a fork of the original [light-monokai](https://github.com/valfur03/Monokai-Theme-for-Typora) theme created by valfur03 for Typora (which is itself inspired by the well-known Monokai theme by Wimer Hazenberg).

I personally really enjoy using the Monokai Machine filter on VSCode so I decided to recreate something similar on Typora (maybe one day there will be an official Typora Monokai theme!). I changed the colors to more closely match the Machine filter and I also increased the font size as I found the original light-monokai font sizes were a bit too small for my liking.

Enjoy!
